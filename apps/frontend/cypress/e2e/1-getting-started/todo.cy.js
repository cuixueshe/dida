// Welcome to Cypress!

// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:

    // so we must tell it to visit our website with the `cy.visit()` command.
    // Since we want to visit the same URL at the start of all our tests,
    // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
    // todo
    // 后面需要基于环境来区分不同的 host
